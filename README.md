2011-2018 Francisco Salary Database EDA

This project was done to see which jobs got paid better over the years(2011-2018) in San Francisco.
This is the EDA version of the San Francisco Salary Database but it's cleaned version will also be uploaded here in the future.
The data was analysed and visualised employing a variety of Python libraries, such as pandas,NumPy,matplotlib,seaborn. 
All the coding phase was done on a Jupyter notebook. 

Meanings of the each ColumnNames we have.

EmployeeName:Shows each Employee Name

JobTitle:Shows the job title of each Employee

BasePay:Base Pay Salary for each Employee

OvertimePay:The overtime Pay Salary for each Employee

OtherPay:if the Employees have any other Salary

Benefits:indicate any Benefits

TotalPay:Sum of BasePay, OverTimePay and OtherPay

TotalPayBenefits:Sum of TotalPay and Benefits

Year:2011 to 2018

In the FranciscoCleaning file you will see that all the NaN values and all the 0 values have been taken out so the proper BasePay or any other Column statistics could be analyzed properly.
Indexing inconsistencies that came along with the cleaning have been fixed.
Most popular jobs and the most paying jobs have been analyzed.
You will see that there is no more info about the year 2011 in Cleaning version even though it was on the EDA version.2011 year entries did not repeat themselves throught the years so the changes on those jobs,pays,benefits could not be analyzed therefore 2011 year entries have been taken out completely.

Note to Self : - Cleaning could have been done more efficently
               - Lots of room to keep on analyzing.
               - Can be coupled with another counties salary database to see how jobs and people's earnings have changed throught the years compared to different counties.
               - Predictions about the next years pay,benefits etc. can be done.
